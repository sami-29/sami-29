**`Junior Frontend Developer`** 

I'm Bentaleb Sami, a 20 year old algerian computer science student at the university of Badji Moukhtar Annaba i am currently third year which means i'll get my license diploma this year.
I am also mostly a self taught web developer with 2-3 years of experience programming i started out with python, just solving leet code and project euler problems and fun projects, then i wanted to specialize in web development and i found the easier way is to start with frontend so i did just that.
